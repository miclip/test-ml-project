# Product Guide: Customer Churn Prediction

## Initial Concept

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using historical data, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## Vision

Empower data analysts and business stakeholders with accurate, interpretable churn predictions that enable timely intervention for at-risk customers, ultimately reducing customer attrition and improving retention rates.

## Target Users

- **Data Analysts** - Professionals who analyze customer data patterns and generate reports on churn trends
- **Business Stakeholders** - Decision-makers who use churn insights to drive retention strategies and allocate resources effectively

## Core Capabilities

1. **Churn Prediction Model** - A scikit-learn based classification model that predicts the likelihood of customer churn based on behavioral and demographic features

2. **Batch Scoring** - Ability to score entire customer datasets to identify at-risk segments

3. **Feature Importance Analysis** - Visibility into which factors contribute most to churn predictions, enabling actionable insights

4. **Experiment Tracking** - MLflow integration for tracking model experiments, parameters, and performance metrics

5. **Interactive Analysis** - Jupyter notebook environment for exploratory data analysis and model development

## Success Metrics

- Model accuracy and precision in identifying churning customers
- Reduction in customer churn rate after implementing model-driven interventions
- Time saved in identifying at-risk customers compared to manual analysis

## Constraints

- Predictions are based on historical data quality and availability
- Model requires periodic retraining as customer behavior patterns evolve
