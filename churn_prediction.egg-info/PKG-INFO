# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn using historical data.

Developed entirely using [cc-conductor](https://github.com/malston/cc-conductor) to test ML style guides 

## Overview

This project uses scikit-learn to build a classification model that predicts
whether customers will churn based on their behavior and demographics.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
